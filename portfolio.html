                  <li>Deferred Renderer</li>
                  <p>I created an <a href="https://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL</a> 3D graphics engine that uses the advanced
                     technique of Deferred Rendering. In my deferred renderer, the vertex positions of the geometry, the
                     surface normals, the light positions, and the base colors of the objects are all first written to
                     textures. These textures are sampled to produce the final image. With this tech, the scene can
                     support hundreds of dynamic lights instead of only the handful a traditional forward renderer
                     supplies.</p>
                     <li>Raytracer</li>
                  <p>To the right, you can see a scene I made with my traditional software raytracer. Raytracing works
                     by casting light simulating rays from the camera's perspective into the scene. The objects that
                     intersect with the rays have their color and normals sampled. The rays then take bounce in the
                     direction of the lights in the scene. If the rays reach a light, then intersection points earlier
                     on surfaces are lit. Realistic, physically based rendering simulations are achieved with
                     raytracing. My raytracer supports spheres, ellipses, bounding boxes, cylinders, reflections, and
                     basic texturing.

                  <li>Forward Renderer with dynamic geometry</li>
                  <p>Dr. Sueda, as a part of <a
                        href="https://people.engr.tamu.edu/sueda/courses/CSCE441/2022S/index.html">441: Computer
                        Graphics</a>, had us make a traditional forward-based renderer with a free-look camera
                     controlled with the mouse. Movement in the scene is accomplished with the WASD, as in many video
                     games. Graphics hardware acceleration is supported through <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language">GLSL</a> shader code. Shaders run
                     on the GPU and operate on vertex and texture information provided to the shaders by the
                     programmer's main application. Additionally, we experimented with dynamic geometry transformations
                     and animations generated by GPU geometry shader code.

                  <video controls="" src="images/final_level.mp4" type="mp4"></video>
                  <p>This is a 2D plaformer I designed around a centeral mechanic of having each plaform generate a local gravity field which is manipulated by the player.</p>
                  <li>Mehen Remix</li>
                  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehen_(game)">Mehen</a> is one of the oldest known board
                     games. Mehen boards have been dated to as early as 3000 BC. The rules to Mehen are lost to time. My
                     game design team created a new game using only the traditional known Mehan pieces - a spiral board
                     and round stone game pieces. We used these pieces to create a tactical turn-based strategy game
                     centered around capturing a "sacred realm" on the board and gaining more followers than the rival
                     deity.</p>
